 * 0.6.0
 - Allow "strict" correlation where the link text
   must match too.
 - Cleaner use process: generation of edit and new
   files depends on their status. New files are only
   generated if the correlation if done. Edit files
   are generated only if they differ from their
   corresponding new files.
 - Rewrite Org parser.
 - Fix abscisse size for evolution curves.
 - Provide Herodotos tool suite:
   herodotos (for the correlation), org2sql
   (to push correlated reports in a database),
   and sql2jgr (to generate the graphs from a database)
